            You might not know this but there are more homeless animals than people, Millions of dogs are sent to animal shelters every year
            and beacuse the number of these animales is pretty big The majority of shelter dogs are euthanized(put to sleep)
            so by Adopting from a shelter your helping saving a life and also it's cheaper...YAAY IKR..
            Shelter dogs are perfectly normal!and they are very kind and usually they are even trained
            so next time you think of buying some fancy dog with a load of money think about steping by your local shelter and save a life and your money
            PS:Most dogs don't ever find a forever home
